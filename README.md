## Features In Detail

### Navigation

- **Section Highlighting**: When you click on a section in the TOC, it will be highlighted briefly for easy identification
- **Collapsible Sections**: Each section can be collapsed independently
- **Expand/Collapse All**: Buttons at the top to expand or collapse all sections at once

### Supported Elements

- **H3 Headings**: Main section titles in AI responses
- **H4 Headings**: Subsection titles
- **Ordered Lists**: Nested list items under headings
- **Strong Text**: Bold text elements that serve as important points

### User Interface

- **TOC Panel**: Fixed sidebar on the right with scrollable contents
- **TOC Handle**: Vertical tab to collapse/expand the entire panel
- **Dark Mode**: Automatically adjusts to browser dark mode settings

## Development

This project includes the following main files:

1. `TOC.js` - The full, unminified source code with comments
2. `TOC-min.js` - The minified version for use as a bookmarklet
3. `minify-toc.js` - Node.js script to minify the code

### Minification Process

The project includes a Node.js script (`minify-toc.js`) that handles minification while preserving the critical `javascript:` prefix required for bookmarklets:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the minification script: `npm run minify`

#### How the Minification Works

The minification script:

1. Preserves the `javascript:` prefix needed for bookmarklets
2. Uses Terser for high-quality JavaScript minification with optimal settings:
   - Multiple optimization passes
   - Unsafe optimizations for smaller output
   - Property mangling for minimized size
   - Comment removal and whitespace optimization
3. Implements additional custom optimizations to further reduce size
4. Reports compression statistics when done

## Technical Notes

- The script injects a styled panel into the page
- It observes DOM changes to update the TOC as the conversation progresses
- Works with both ChatGPT and Grok response formats
- The script distinguishes between user messages and AI responses
- No data is sent to external servers - everything happens locally in your browser
- The bookmarklet's size is optimized for maximum compression

## Notes and Limitations

- This tool does not currently display or navigate edits
- Works with Dark mode automatically (detects system preferences)
- Each section can be collapsed independently
- The entire TOC panel can be collapsed using the vertical handle
- Compatible with both ChatGPT and Grok AI chat interfaces
- No external dependencies - runs completely in the browser
